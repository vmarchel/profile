                        With a background in power engineering, I began my professional career in audit before moving to forensics. While the work was challenging, it was during a technical project that everything clicked for me. That project was tough - really tough - but pushing through it sparked something. By the end, I'd become the person my team turned to for technical problem-solving, and I realized I wanted more of that challenge in my work.

                        That realization led me to explore programming. I started with SQL and Python, searching for what resonated with me. Then I took a CSS and HTML bootcamp, and suddenly everything made sense. I loved the immediate visual feedback, the creativity mixed with logic, the satisfaction of building something people could interact with. I was hooked.

                        I've since completed a six-month front-end development course where I deepened my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learned React. Now I'm focused on building projects that combine clean code with intuitive user experiences. I bring the same persistence and problem-solving mindset from my previous career - just applied to creating web applications I'm genuinely excited about.
